# Relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) for 14CO2: Data and logger program

This repository supports the manuscript "A relaxed eddy accumulation flask sampling system for 14C-based partitioning of fossil and non-fossil CO2 fluxes". It contains:

- 'Logger-Program':
  - Documentation of the CR6 logger program
  - All program versions used to collect REA flasks since July 2022
- 'Data':
  -  Measurement results from quality control tests of the REA system in the laboratory
