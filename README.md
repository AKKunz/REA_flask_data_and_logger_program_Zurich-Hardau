# Relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) for <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>: Data and logger program

This repository supports the manuscript "A relaxed eddy accumulation flask sampling system for <sup>14</sup>C-based partitioning of fossil and non-fossil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes". It contains:

- 'Logger-Program':
  - Documentation of the CR6 logger program
  - All program versions used to collect REA flasks since July 2022 (at three different sites: 1) Hardau, Zurich, Switzerland; 2) Romainville, Paris, France; 3) Blutenburgstra√üe, Munich, Germany)
- 'Data':
  -  Measurement results from quality control tests of the REA system in the laboratory
  -  Measurement results from quality control tests of the REA system during the first REA measurements on a tall-tower in Zurich, Switzerland
  -  Measurement and simulation results from the 103 REA samples collected in Zurich, Switzerland
